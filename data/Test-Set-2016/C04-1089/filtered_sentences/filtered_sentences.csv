4,Comparable corpora such as news documents of the same period from different news agencies are readily available.
10,"Much research has been done on using parallel corpora to learn bilingual lexicons (melamed, 1997; moore, 2003)."
11,"But parallel corpora are scarce resources, especially for uncommon lan guage pairs."
12,Comparable corpora refer to texts that are not direct translation but are about the same topic.
15,"Previous research efforts on acquiring translations from comparable corpora include (fung and yee, 1998; rapp, 1995; rapp, 1999)."
19,"On the other hand, the work of (cao and li, 2002; fung and yee, 1998; koehn and knight, 2002; rapp, 1995; rapp, 1999) used the context of w to locate its translation in a second language."
21,"Since both sources of information are complementary, the accuracy of our combined approach is better than the accuracy of using just context or transliteration information alone."
27,"The work of (fung and yee, 1998; rapp, 1995; rapp, 1999) noted that if an english word e is the translation of a chinese word c , then the contexts of the two words are similar."
35,"We employ the language modeling approach (ng, 2000; ponte and croft, 1998) for corresponding to that document translation of c"
38,"On the other hand, when we only look at the word w itself, we can rely on the pronunciation of w to locate its translation."
39,"We use a variant of within ir, there is a new approach to document retrieval called the language modeling approach (ponte & croft, 98)."
47,"Specifically, our combination method is as follows: we examine the top m the language modeling approach to ir has been shown to give superior retrieval performance (ponte & croft, 98; ng, 2000), compared with traditional vector space model, and we adopt this approach in our current work."
48,"To estimate p(q | d) , we use the approach of (ng, 2000)."
56,/ ∏t ct ! can be omitted as this part depends on the query only and thus is the same for all the documents.
69,"Since most chinese characters have only one pronunciation and hence one pinyin form, we assume that chinese character-to-pinyin mapping is one-to-one to simplify the problem."
77,"Another difference is onaizan and knight, 2002b)."
78,Knight and graehl (1998) proposed a probabilistic model for machine transliteration.
82,Alonaizan and knight (2002b) suggested that pronunciation can be skipped and the target language letters can be mapped directly to source language letters.
91,"To avoid accidentally using parallel texts, we did not use the texts of xinhua news agency them english translation candidate words."
96,"We used a chineseenglish dictionary which contained about 10,000 entries for translating the words in the context."
102,"The context of an english translation candidate word e, c (e) , was similarly collected."
105,"So we first segmented chinese text with a chinese word segmenter that was based on maximum entropy modeling (ng and low, 2004)."
107,"For each chinese source word, we ranked all its english translation candidate words according to the estimated p(c (c) | c (e))"
119,"We call section 4), which was used to rank the english candidate words based on transliteration."
132,We also investigated the effect of varying m
141,Recall is somewhat difficult to estimate because we do not know whether the english translation of a chinese word appears in the english part of the corpus.
142,We attempted to estimate recall by manually finding the english translations for all the chinese source words for the two periods dec 01 – dec 15 and dec 16 – dec 31 in the english part of the corpus.
145,"Precision and recall for different values of m the past research of (fung and yee, 1998; rapp, 1995; rapp, 1999) utilized context information alone and was evaluated on different corpora from ours, so it is difficult to directly compare our current results with theirs."
146,"Similarly, alonaizan and knight (2002a; 2002b) only made use of transliteration information alone and so was not directly comparable."
151,"Since our method currently only considers unigram english words, we are not able to find translations for these words."
152,But it is not difficult to extend our method to handle this problem.
167,"As shown in table 3, using just context information alone, 10 chinese words (the first 10) have their correct english translations at rank one position."
174,"On the other hand, the work of (cao and li, 2002; fung and yee, 1998; rapp, 1995; rapp, 1999) used only the context of w to locate its translation in a second language."
176,"Koehn and knight (2002) attempted to combine multiple clues, including similar context and spelling."
177,But their similar spelling clue uses the longest common subsequence ratio and works only for cognates (words with a very similar spelling).
178,"The work that is most similar to ours is the recent research of (huang et al., 2004)."
179,They attempted to improve named entity translation by combining phonetic and semantic information.
180,Their contextual semantic similarity model is different from our language modeling approach to measuring context similarity.
182,"They combined the two sources of information by weighting the two individual scores, whereas we made use of the average rank for combination."
183,"In this paper, we proposed a new method to mine new word translations from comparable corpora, by combining context and transliteration information, which are complementary sources of information."
