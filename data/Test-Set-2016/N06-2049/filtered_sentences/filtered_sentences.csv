2,We proposed two approaches to improve chinese word segmentation: a subword-based tagging and a confidence measure approach.
3,"We found the former achieved better performance than the existing character-based tagging, and the latter improved segmentation further by combining the former with a dictionary-based segmentation."
5,"By these techniques we achieved higher f-scores in cityu, pku and msr corpora than the best results from sighan bakeoff 2005."
6,"The character-based “iob” tagging approach has been widely used in chinese word segmentation recently (xue and shen, 2003; peng and mccallum, 2004; tseng et al., 2005)."
7,"Under the scheme, each character of a word is labeled as ‘b’ if it is the first character of a multiple-character word, or ‘o’ if the character functions as an independent word, or ‘i’ otherwise.” for example, ” (whole) (beijing city)” is labeled as ” (whole)/o (north)/b (capital)/i (city)/i”."
8,We found that so far all the existing implementations were using character-based iob tagging.
9,"In this work we propose a subword-based iob tagging, which assigns tags to a predefined lexicon subset consisting of the most frequent multiple-character words in addition to single chinese characters."
10,"If only chinese characters are used, the subword-based iob tagging is downgraded into a character-based one."
11,"Taking the same example mentioned above, “ (whole) (beijing city)” is labeled as ” (whole)/o (beijing)/b (city)/i” in the subword-based tagging, where ” (beijing)/b” is labeled as one unit."
15,"In the results of the closed test in bakeoff 2005 (emerson, 2005), the work of (tseng et al., 2005), using conditional random fields (crf) for the iob tagging, yielded very high r-oovs in all of the four corpora used, but the r-iv rates were lower."
17,In this work we propose a confidence measure approach to lessen the weakness.
18,By this approach we can change r-oovs and r-ivs and find an optimal tradeoff.
27,"Since the dictionary-based approach is a well-known method, we skip its technical descriptions."
28,"However, keep in mind that the dictionary-based approach can produce a higher r-iv rate."
31,There are several steps to train a subword-based iob tag- ger.
35,"If the subset consists of chinese characters only, it is a character-based iob tagger."
38,"For a character-based iob tagger, there is only one possibility of re-segmentation."
39,"However, there are multiple choices for a subword-based iob tagger."
42,We did not conduct comparative experiments because trivial differences of these approaches may not result in significant consequences to the subword-based ap proach.
43,"In the third step, we used the crfs approach to train the iob tagger (lafferty et al., 2001) on the training data."
49,The subscripts are position indicators.
51,"For the bigram features, we only used the previous and the current observations, t−1 t0"
58,The dictionary-based segmentation produced results with higher r-ivs but lower r-oovs while the iob tagging yielded the contrary results.
59,In this section we introduce a confidence measure approach to combine the two results.
60,"We define a confidence measure, c m(tiob |w), to measure the confidence of the results produced by the iob tagging by using the results from the dictionary-based segmentation."
62,"Its calculation is defined as: c m(tiob |w) = αc miob (tiob |w) + (1 − α)δ(tw , tiob )ng (2) where tiob is the word w’s iob tag assigned by the iob tagging; tw , a prior iob tag determined by the results of the dictionary-based segmentation."
63,"After the dictionary- based word segmentation, the words are re-segmented into subwords by fmm before being fed to iob tagging."
64,"Each subword is given a prior iob tag, tw"
65,"C miob (t|w), a  m  confidence probability derived in the process of iob tag exp )' )' λk fk (ti−1 , ti , w ) + )' µk gk (ti , w ) /z,  i=1  k k   (1) ging, is defined as z = )' t =t0 t1 ···tm p(t |w ) c miob (t|w ) = l,t =t0 t1 ···tm ,ti =t p(t |w, wi ) t =t 0 t1 ··· tm p ( t | w ) where we call fk (ti−1 , ti , w ) bigram feature functions because the features trigger the previous observation ti−1 where the numerator is a sum of all the observation sequences with word wi labeled as t"
66,"Δ(tw , tiob )ng denotes the contribution of the dictionary- based segmentation."
68,"2, α is a weighting between the iob tagging and the dictionary-based word segmentation."
71,"A confidence measure threshold, t, was defined for making a decision based on the value."
72,"If the value was lower than t, the iob tag was rejected and the dictionary-based segmentation was used; otherwise, the iob tagging segmentation was used."
77,We used the data provided by sighan bakeoff 2005 to test our approaches described in the previous sections.
82,"Of the corpora and these scores, refer to (emerson, 2005)."
83,"For the dictionary-based approach, we extracted a word list from the training data as the vocabulary."
85,Table 1 shows the performance of the dictionary-based segmentation.
87,"In fact, there were no oov recognition."
94,"The segmentation results of the dictionary-based were re-segmented table 1: our segmentation results by the dictionary- based approach for the closed test of bakeoff 2005, very low r-oov rates due to no oov recognition applied."

102,"The segmentation results using crf tagging are shown in table 2, where the upper numbers of each slot were produced by the character-based approach while the lower numbers were of the subword-based."
103,"We found that the proposed subword-based approaches were effective in cityu and msr corpora, raising the f-scores from 0.941 to 0.946 for cityu corpus, 0.959 to 0.964 for msr corpus."
105,"Comparing table 1 and 2, we found the crf-modeled iob tagging yielded better segmentation than the dictionary- based approach."
109,"In section 2.2, we proposed a confidence measure approach to reevaluate the results of iob tagging by combinations of the results of the dictionary-based segmentation."

121,"Even with the use of confidence measure, the word- based iob tagging still outperformed the character-based iob tagging."
122,It proves the proposed word-based iob tagging was very effective.
123,The iob tagging approach adopted in this work is not a new idea.
124,"It was first used in chinese word segmentation by (xue and shen, 2003), where maximum entropy methods were used."
125,"Later, this approach was implemented by the crf-based method (peng and mccallum, 2004), which was proved to achieve better results than the maximum entropy approach because it can solve the label bias problem (lafferty et al., 2001)."
127,We proved the new approach enhanced the word segmentation significantly.
128,Our results are listed together with the best results from bakeoff 2005 in table 4 in terms of f-scores.
129,"We achieved the highest f-scores in cityu, pku and msr corpora."
130,We think our proposed subword- based tagging played an important role for the good results.
134,"For as corpus, “adam smith” are two words in the training but become a one- word in the test, “adamsmith”."
137,The subword-based approach is faster because fewer words than characters were labeled.
141,"By way of the confidence measure we combined results from the dictionary-based and the iob-tagging-based and as a result, we could achieve the optimal performance."
142,"In this work, we proposed a subword-based iob tagging method for chinese word segmentation."
143,"Using the crfs approaches, we prove that it outperformed the character- based method using the crf approaches."
144,We also successfully employed the confidence measure to make a confidence-dependent word segmentation.
145,This approach is effective for performing desired segmentation based on users’ requirements to r-oov and r-iv.
