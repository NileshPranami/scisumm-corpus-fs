2,Most traditional approaches to anaphora resolution rely heavily on linguistic and domain knowledge.
4,"This paper pres­ ents a robust, knowledge-poor approach to resolving pronouns in technical manuals, which operates on texts pre-processed by a part-of-speech tagger."
7,Evaluation reports a success rate of 89.7% which is better than the suc­ cess rates of the approaches selected for comparison and tested on the same data.
8,"In addition, preliminary experiments show that the approach can be success­ fully adapted for other languages with minimum modifications."
9,"For the most part, anaphora resolution has focused on traditional linguistic methods (carbonell & brown 1988; carter 1987; hobbs 1978; ingria & stallard 1989; lappin & mccord 1990; lappin & leass 1994; mitkov 1994; rich & luperfoy 1988; sidner 1979; webber 1979)."
10,"However, to represent and manipulate the various types of linguistic and domain knowledge involved requires considerable human input and computational expense."
11,"While various alternatives have been proposed, making use of e.g"
12,"Neural networks, a situation se­ mantics framework, or the principles of reasoning with uncertainty (e.g"
13,"1994; mitkov 1995; tin & akman 1995), there is still a strong need for the development of robust and effective strategies to meet the demands of practical nlp systems, and to enhance further the automatic pro­ cessing of growing language resources."
14,Several proposals have already addressed the anaphora resolution problem by deliberately limiting the extent to which they rely on domain and/or lin­ guistic knowledge (baldwin 1997; dagan & ltai 1990; kennedy & boguraev 1996; mitkov 1998; nasukawa 1994; williams et al
15,"Our work is a continuation of these latest trends in the search for inexpensive, fast and reliable procedures for anaph­ ora resolution."
16,It is also an example of how anaphors in a specific genre can be resolved quite successfully without any sophisticated linguistic knowledge or even without parsing.
17,"Finally, our evaluation shows that the basic set of antecedent tracking indicators can work well not only for english, but also for other languages (in our case polish and arabic)."
18,"With a view to avoiding complex syntactic, seman­ tic and discourse analysis (which is vital for real­ world applications), we developed a robust, knowl­ edge-poor approach to pronoun resolution which does not parse and analyse the input in order to identify antecedents of anaphors."
19,"It makes use of only a part-of-speech tagger, plus simple noun phrase rules (sentence constituents are identified at the level of noun phrase at most) and operates on the basis of antecedent-tracking preferences (referred to hereafter as ""antecedent indicators"")."
22,"If immediate reference has not been identified, then priority is given to the candi date with the best collocation pattern score."
26,Antecedent indicators (preferences) play a decisive role in tracking down the antecedent from a set of possible candidates.
28,"The antecedent indicators have been identi­ fied empirically and are related to salience (definiteness, givenness, indicating verbs, lexical reiteration, section heading preference, ""non­ prepositional"" noun phrases), to structural matches (collocation, immediate reference), to referential distance or to preference of terms."
33,"This rule is ignored if there are no definite articles, possessive or demonstrative pro­ nouns in the paragraph (this exception is taken into account because some english user's guides tend to omit articles)."
34,"Givenness noun phrases in previous sentences representing the ""given information"" (theme) 1 are deemed good candidates for antecedents and score i (candidates not representing the theme score 0)."
35,"In a coherent text (firbas 1992), the given or known information, or theme, usually appears first, and thus forms a co­ referential link with the preceding text."
37,1we use the simple heuristics that the given information is the first noun phrase in a non-imperative sentence.
40,"Lexical reiteration lexically reiterated items are likely candidates for antecedent (a np scores 2 if is repeated within the same paragraph twice or more, 1 if repeated once and 0 if not)."
42,"Also, a sequence of noun phrases with the same head counts as lexical reiteration (e.g"
47,"Here ""the vcr"" is penalised (-1) for being part of the prepositional phrase ""into the vcr""."
50,1987) and noun phrases which are parts of prepositional phrases are usually indirect objects.
51,"Collocation pattern preference this preference is given to candidates which have an identical collocation pattern with a pronoun (2,0)."
53,"Owing to lack of syntactic information, this preference is somewhat weaker than the collocation preference described in (dagan & ltai 1990)."
59,This preference can be viewed as a modification of the collocation preference.
65,"For anaphors in simple sentences, noun phrases in the previous sen­ tence are the best candidate for antecedent, followed by noun phrases situated 2 sentences further back and finally nouns 3 sentences further back {1, 0, -1)."
67,21dentification of clauses in complex sentences is do e heuristically.
69,These scores have been determined experimentally on an empirical basis and are constantly being up­ dated.
79,Look for noun phrases3 only to the left of the anaphor4 2.
81,Those which agree in gender and numbers with the pronominal anaphor and group them as a set of potential candidates
92,"For practical reasons, the approach presented does not incorporate syntactic and semantic information (other than a list of domain terms) and it is not real­ istic to expect its performance to be as good as an approach which makes use of syntactic and semantic knowledge in terms of constraints and preferences."
93,"The lack of syntactic information, for instance, means giving up c-cornmand constraints and subject preference (or on other occasions object preference, see mitkov i995) which could be used in center tracking."
95,Lack of semantic knowledge rules out the use of verb se­ mantics and semantic parallelism.
97,"In fact, our evaluation shows that the re­ sults are comparable to syntax-based methods (lappin & leass i994)."
98,We believe that the good success rate is due to the fact that a number of ante­ cedent indicators are taken into account and no fac­ tor is given absolute preference.
99,"In particular, this strategy can often override incorrect decisions linked with strong centering preference (mitkov & belguith i998) or syntactic and semantic parallelism prefer­ ences (see below)."
101,Our first evaluation exercise (mitkov & stys 1997) was based on a random sample text from a technical manual in english (minolta 1994).
104,"The approach being robust (an attempt is made to resolve each anaphor and a pro­ posed antecedent is returned), this figure represents both ""precision"" and ""recall"" if we use the muc terminology."
108,"Given that our knowledge­ poor approach is basically an enhancement of a baseline model through a set of antecedent indica­ tors, we see a dramatic improvement in performance (95.8%) when these preferences are called upon."
109,"Typically, our preference-based model proved superior to both baseline models when the antece­ dent was neither the most recent subject nor the most recent noun phrase matching the anaphor in gender and number."
112,From this example we can also see that our knowledge-poor approach successfully tackles cases in which the anaphor and the· antecedent have not only different syntactic functions but also different semantic roles.
113,"Usually knowledge-based ap­ proaches have difficulties in such a situation because they use preferences such as ""syntactic parallelism"" or ""semantic parallelism""."
114,Our robust approach does not use these because it has no information about the syntactic structure of the sentence or about the syn­ tactic function/semantic role of each individual word.
120,We carried out a second evaluation of the approach on a different set of sample texts from the genre of technical manuals (47-page portable style-writer user's guide (stylewriter 1994).
124,"Another reason for doing it by hand is to ensure a fair comparison with breck baldwin's method, which not being available to us, had to be hand-simulated (see 3.3)."
126,"The ""baseline subject"" model tested on the same data scored 33.9% recall and 67.9% precision, whereas ""baseline most recent"" scored 66.7%."
127,"Note that ""baseline subject"" can be assessed both in terms of recall and precision because this ""version"" is not robust: in the event of no subject being available, it is not able to propose an antecedent (the manual guide used as evaluation text contained many im­ perative zero-subject sentences)."
129,"This measure (mitkov 1998b) applies only to anaphors ""ambiguous"" from the point of view of number and gender (i.e"
130,"To those ""tough"" anaphors which, after activating the gender and number filters, still have more than one candidate for antecedent) and is indicative of the performance of the antecedent indicators."
134,"Similarly to the first evaluation, we found that the robust approach was not very successful on sen­ tences with too complicated syntax - a price we have to pay for the ""convenience"" of developing a knowl­ edge-poor system."
141,"In terms of frequency of use (""number of nonzero applications""/""number of anaphors""), the most fre­ quently used indicator proved to be referential dis­ tance used in 98.9% of the cases, followed by term preference (97.8%), givenness (83.3%), lexical reit­ eration (64.4%), definiteness (40%), section heading (37.8%), immediate reference (31.1%) and colloca­ tion (11.1%)."
145,The reason is that both our approach and breck baldwin's approach share common principles (both are knowledge-poor and use a pos tagger to provide the input) and therefore a comparison would be appropriate.
146,"Given that our approach is robust and returns an­ tecedent for each pronoun, in order to make the comparison as fair as possible, we used cogniac's ""resolve all"" version by simulating it manually on the same training data used in evaluation b above."
147,Cogniac successfully resolved the pronouns in 75% of the cases.
148,This result is comparable with the results described in (baldwin 1997).
149,"For the training data from the genre of technical manuals, it was rule 5 (see baldwin 1997) which was most frequently used (39% of the cases, 100% success), followed by rule 8 (33% of the cases, 33% success), rule 7 (11%, 100%), rule i (9%, 100%) and rule 3 (7.4%, 100%)."
151,"Languages an attractive feature of any nlp approach would be its language ""universality""."
152,"While we acknowledge that most of the monolingual nlp approaches are not automatically transferable (with the same degree of efficiency) to other languages, it would be highly desirable if this could be done with minimal adapta­ tion."
153,We used the robust approach as a basis for devel­ oping a genre-specific reference resolution approach in polish.
154,"As expected, some of the preferences had to be modified in order to fit with specific features of polish (mitkov & stys 1997)."
156,"The evaluation for polish was based technical manuals available on the internet (internet manual, 1994; java manual 1998)."
158,The robust approach adapted for polish demonstrated a high success rate of 93.3% in resolv­ ing anaphors (with critical success rate of 86.2%).
159,"Similarly to the evaluation for english, we com­ pared the approach for polish with (i) a baseline model which discounts candidates on the basis of agreement in number and gender and, if there were still competing candidates, selects as the antecedent the most recent subject matching the anaphor in gender and number (ii) a baseline model which checks agreement in number and gender and, if there were still more than one candidate left, picks up as the antecedent the most recent noun phrase that agrees with the anaphor."
160,Our preference-based approach showed clear su­ periority over both baseline models.
162,"There­ fore, the 93.3% success rate (see above) demon­ strates a dramatic increase in precision, which is due to the use of antecedent tracking preferences."
163,We have recently adapted the approach for ara­ bic as well (mitkov & belguith 1998).
164,"Our evalua­ tion, based on 63 examples (anaphors) from a tech­ nical manual (sony 1992), indicates a success rate of 95.2% (and critical success rate 89.3 %)."
165,"We have described a robust, knowledge-poor ap­ proach to pronoun resolution which operates on texts pre-processed by a part-of-speech tagger."
166,"Evaluation shows a success rate of 89.7% for the genre of tech­ nical manuals and at least in this genre, the approach appears to be more successful than other similar methods."
167,We have also adapted and evaluated the approach for polish (93.3 % success rate) and for arabic (95.2% success rate).
