4,Preliminary experiments show that espresso extracts highly precise lists of a wide variety of semantic relations when compared with two state of the art systems.
12,"Indeed, for each semantic relation, the system builds specific lexical patterns inferred from textual corpora."
14,"In order to start the extraction process, a user provides only a small set of seed instances of a target relation (e.g"
17,"To guarantee weakest supervision, espresso combines its bootstrapping approach with a web-based knowledge expansion technique and linguistic analysis, exploiting the seeds as much as possible."
21,Hearst [12] pioneered using patterns to extract hyponym (is-a) relations.
23,"Berland and charniak [1] propose a system for part-of relation extraction, based on the hearst approach [12]."
26,"Improving upon berland and charniak [1], girju et al"
27,"[11] employ machine learning algorithms and wordnet [8] to disambiguate part-of generic patterns, like [whole-np’s part- np]."
33,A simple and effective algorithm is proposed to infer surface patterns from a small set of instance seeds by extracting all substrings relating seeds in corpus sentences.
37,"[17] proposed a similar, highly scalable approach, based on an edit-distance technique, to learn lexicopos patterns, showing both good performances and efficiency."
39,"Other pattern-based algorithms include riloff and shepherd [21], who used a semiautomatic method for discovering similar words using a few seed examples by using pattern-based techniques and human supervision, knowitall [7] that performs large-scale extraction of facts from the web, mann [15] and fleischman et al"
40,"[9] who used part of speech patterns to extract a subset of is-a relations involving proper nouns, and downey et al"
41,[6] who formalized the problem of relation extraction in a coherent and effective combinatorial model that is shown to outperform previous probabilistic frameworks.
43,"These methods employ clustering algorithms to group words according to their meanings in text, label the clusters using its members’ lexical or syntactic dependencies, and then extract an is-a relation between each cluster member and the cluster label."
44,"Caraballo [3] proposed the first attempt, which used conjunction and apposition features to build noun clusters."
45,"Recently, pantel and ravichandran [16] extended this approach by making use of all syntactic dependency features for each noun."
46,"The advantage of clustering approaches is that they permit algorithms to identify is-a relations that do not explicitly appear in text, however they generally fail to produce coherent clusters from fewer than 100 million words; hence they are unreliable for small corpora."
52,"In the second phase, we define a reliability measure to select the best set of patterns p'⊆p"
53,"In phase three, the patterns in p' are used to extract a set of instances i"
54,"Finally, in phase four, espresso scores each instance and then selects the best instances i' as input seeds for the next iteration."
63,"Thus, unlike many approaches for automatic relation extraction, we allow complex multi-word terms as anchor points."
75,"Hence, when dealing with bigger corpora, the system allows the use of sx,y∪sgx,y in order to extract substrings."
85,The reliability of the manually supplied seed instances are rι(i) = 1.
88,"To address this, we multiply pmi(i, p) with the discounting factor suggested in [16]."
131,Semantic relations espresso is designed to extract various semantic relations exemplified by a given small set of seed instances.
132,"For our preliminary evaluation, we consider the standard is-a and part-of relations as well as three novel relations:  succession: this relation indicates that one proper noun succeeds another in a position or title."
141,"For each semantic relation, we manually extracted a set of seed examples."
146,"For each output set, per relation, we evaluate the precision of the system by extracting a random sample of instances (50 for the trec corpus and 20 for the 1 pr04 does not require any seeds.."
191,The relative recall is always given in relation to the espresso system.
197,"Similarly, pr04 has a relative recall of 0.23 with espresso, which means that pr04 outputs 4.35 fewer correct relations than espresso (also with a smaller precision)."
200,"However, espresso fails to match the recall level of rh02 in all but the experiment on the production relation."
204,"We ran an experiment on the reaction relation, retaining the generic patterns produced during espresso’s selection process."
216,"We tested the 7,634 instances extracted by the generic pattern [x of y] on the chem corpus for the part-of relation."
225,"Preliminary results show that espresso generates highly precise relations, but at the expense of lower recall."
226,"As mentioned above in section 4.3, we are working on improving system recall with a web-based method to identify generic patterns and filter their instances."
229,We expect here that negative instances will play a key role in determining the selectional restriction on generic patterns.
