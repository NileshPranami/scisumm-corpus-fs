TITLE

Continuity and individuality in Medieval Hereford, England: A stable isotope approach to bulk bone and incremental dentine

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

Coupled with archaeological, historical, and palaeopathological observations, stable isotope analysis is an increasingly valuable tool to examine palaeodietary, geographic, and temporal differences in past human populations (Lee-Thorp, 2008; Müldner and Richards, 2005, 2006, 2007a, 2007b).

Typically, such analyses have been undertaken through sampling bone collagen, focusing on the ratios of carbon (13C/12C, δ13C) and nitrogen (15N/14N, δ15N), to estimate the proportion of plant, animal, and fish protein in a population's diet, along with possible indicators of stress or illness, based on several well-established principles (Balasse and Ambrose, 2005; Beaumont and Montgomery, 2016; Cerling, 1993; Lee-Thorp, 2008).

As such, the δ15N values of sampled collagen will increase significantly when an individual's diet includes protein from fish, meat or animal secondary products (Schoeninger and DeNiro, 1984).

These values may further be lowered by anabolic events, such as growth and pregnancy, and increased by catabolic events, such as malnutrition and illness (Fuller et al., 2004, 2005, 2006; Mekota et al., 2006; Waters-Rist and Katzenberg, 2010).

Typically, δ13C values will predominantly reflect the photosynthetic pathway (C3 or C4) of plants at the bottom of the food chain (Farquhar et al., 1989).

Increased δ13C values can also indicate the presence of marine protein in a person's diet, due to the heightening effect of carbon reservoirs on the δ13C values of marine organisms, or access to imported plant protein such as millet (Schoeninger and DeNiro, 1984).

PARAGRAPH

Using these principles, δ13C and δ15N profiles for burial populations have been created to estimate the relationship between the diet, health, and socio-economic status of past populations and to provide comparisons with historical evidence (e.g. Curtis-Summers et al., 2014; Katzenberg and Lovell, 1999; Müldner and Richards, 2005, 2006, 2007a, 2007b; Thompson et al., 2008).

Most commonly, these have been carried out on bone collagen, but such isotope values face the challenge that they may reflect an average of the last twenty years or more of an individual's life, depending on the rate of bone remodelling (Cox and Sealy, 1997; Hedges et al., 2007).

These challenges are exacerbated by factors such as imprecise assessments of age at death, failure to resolve short-term events, and limitations in fully representative sampling, due to the inherent biases in the demography of burial populations (AlQahtani et al., 2010; Beaumont et al., 2015; Reynard and Tuross, 2015; Wood et al., 1992).

However, recently refined techniques, utilising incremental primary dentine instead of bone collagen have overcome many of these issues.

Primary dentine does not remodel and mineralises in a highly regular manner, recording discrete isotope values at incremental lines of growth during formation (Beaumont and Montgomery, 2015; Beaumont et al., 2013, 2014; Lee-Thorp, 2008).

By sectioning primary dentine at specific intervals, isotope values can be assigned approximate known formation times and the age at which each section formed can be estimated (Beaumont and Montgomery, 2015).

Using this approach, it is possible to point out specific occurrences in past individuals' lives, often related to specific events such as periods of famine (Beaumont and Montgomery, 2016), illness (Fuller et al., 2005) or weaning (Fuller et al., 2006), predominantly during childhood (cf. Beaumont and Montgomery, 2015; Beaumont et al., 2013, 2014, 2015; Eerkens et al., 2016; Montgomery et al., 2013; Sandberg et al., 2014; van der Sluis et al., 2015).

PARAGRAPH

In this paper, δ13C and δ15N profiles constructed from incrementally sampled dentine, reflecting approximately the first 23 years of life (Beaumont and Montgomery, 2015), are presented from five individuals with similar isotopic bone values.

The individuals were chosen from a pool of δ13C and δ15N bulk bone collagen data from Medieval Hereford, England, as they had high δ15N values and all survived into adulthood.

We will discuss the contribution of this incremental data to the bulk bone collagen interpretation within the context of Medieval palaeodietary research, asking whether the high δ15N bulk bone values were consistent through the childhood and adolescence of the five individuals.

Further, we consider any mutual characteristics present in the incremental profiles that could be attributed to underlying physiological changes during growth and development, rather than episodes of illness, famine or dietary change.

The burial populations

SECTION

St Guthlac's Priory

PARAGRAPH

St. Guthlac's Priory in Hereford, England, (established c.7th century CE) was originally located in the Castle Green area near Hereford Cathedral.

Later, it was moved to its current location at the modern-day County Hospital in 1144, where it operated until 1539 (Fig. 1).

All mentions of St. Guthlac's Priory in this paper refer to its latter location.

During excavations between 1998 and 2003, masonry associated with the priory, and a burial ground with numerous skeletal remains, were uncovered (Crooks, 2005).

The burial ground at this later St. Guthlac's Priory appears to have served local parishioners (St. Peter's parish) of Hereford rather than the priory exclusively, with interments of men, women, and children, and no signs of a separate area for monks (Boucher et al., 2015; Crooks, 2005).

Since the relocation of St. Guthlac's, Hereford Cathedral held a burial monopoly in Hereford, claiming all parishioners whose goods at the time of death exceeded 6 shillings, while women and those of lesser means were buried in their local parishes (Boucher et al., 2015, p. 11; Forrest, 2010, p. 1120).

However, historical evidence indicates that in 1382, parishioners could choose where they were buried, suggesting that St. Guthlac's Priory was eventually the burial place of individuals from all socioeconomic backgrounds (Forrest, 2010, p. 1131).

PARAGRAPH

Palaeopathological analysis of the burial population showed a high rate of dental caries, infection, anaemia, as well as accident- and work-related joint disease, suggesting a poor living environment, while no signs of unusual pathologies were present (Roberts, 2005; Crooks, 2005).

The burial ground included at least two internment phases, the first of which appears to date to the late 12th and early 13th centuries, but the cemetery was in use until the early 16th century (Crooks, 2005).

SECTION

The Cathedral Close

PARAGRAPH

The origins of the bishopric at Hereford go back to the late 7th century CE, with at least two Anglo-Saxon predecessor churches attested to through written documents, possibly including the former St. Guthlac's church at the Castle Green location, but archaeological evidence is scarce (Boucher et al., 2015, 1–14).

The existing Cathedral dates to the first half of the 12th century and was a popular pilgrimage site throughout the Middle Ages as the final resting place of Saint Æthelberht, an 8th century Anglo-Saxon king and martyr, and later of Saint Thomas de Cantilupe (died 1282 CE, canonized 1320) (Boucher et al., 2015, pp. 1–14).

Excavations in the modern Cathedral Close area in 1993 and 2009–11 have uncovered over 6000 individuals.

Most of the burials date from after c. 1100 CE, while a large pit of disarticulated human remains was moved during the construction of the 12th century cathedral (Boucher et al., 2015, pp. 11, 23).

The site was used for burial again from the late 12th to the 16th century and three Medieval mass graves in the area have been linked to outbreaks of the Black Death in the city in 1348–49 and 1361 (Boucher et al., 2015, 23–25).

Very little is known about the Early Medieval and separate Later Medieval occupants of the mass graves.

Burial rites observed for some of the Early Medieval Cathedral Close and St. Guthlac's Priory skeletons imply varied status among individuals from both burial grounds, with those in stone cists and coffins possibly being wealthier than those in simple shroud burials (Table 1).

Due to the burial monopoly the Cathedral gained, the Early Medieval cemetery likely contains individuals from both urban and rural communities from varying levels of socioeconomic status (Boucher et al., 2015, p. 11; Forrest, 2010).

Materials and methods

SECTION

Sample selection

PARAGRAPH

The 20 bulk bone collagen samples from the Cathedral Close were analysed as part of the initial assessment of the 1993 excavations (Hurst et al., 2003) (Table 2).

They were selected to include individuals from the main chronological phases and comprised ten samples from the Earliest Medieval burial phase, and ten from the later Medieval ‘plague pits’.

A further 29 individuals from the St Guthlac's Priory burial population were analysed for bulk bone collagen for a Medieval dietary study (Table 1).

Individuals were chosen for analysis based on sample availability from the Durham University Fenwick Human Osteology Laboratory Hereford collection, and where available, cortical bone from ribs was preferred to long bones.

For the incremental primary dentine study, paired mandibular left third molars (M3) and canines were taken from a sub-sample of five adult individuals based on their similarly high δ15N bulk bone results (Table 1; Fig. 2).

This would allow for the determination of whether these high values were consistent throughout their lives.

SECTION

Sample preparation and stable isotope analysis

PARAGRAPH

The bone samples from Hereford Cathedral Close were analysed in 2002 in the Department of Archaeological Sciences, University of Bradford, using the modified Longin method with ultrafiltration following Brown et al. (1988), as described in Müldner and Richards (2005).

PARAGRAPH

For the St. Guthlac's Priory samples, 100–200 mg sections were cut from bone elements, while teeth were bisected and enamel removed from one half of the tooth following method 2 outlined by Beaumont et al. (2013).

Secondary dentine was also removed by abrading the pulp chamber (Beaumont et al., 2015).

Tooth and bone elements were demineralised in 0.5 M HCl at 4 °C.

Once demineralised, teeth were cut into horizontal sections (c. 1 mm) from crown to root apex and each section placed into a separately labelled micro tube.

Collagen was extracted following the original Longin (1971) method and gelatinised bone collagen was Ezee filtered.

Dentine filtration was considered unnecessary due to the lack of exogenous debris compared to bone (Beaumont et al., 2014).

Samples were frozen, then freeze-dried at −30 °C and 300 mm Hg for 48 h.

The resulting collagen was weighed to calculate the minimum collagen yield.

All tools and surfaces were thoroughly cleaned between samples to avoid cross-contamination.

SECTION

Data analysis

PARAGRAPH

Analytic uncertainty of standards appears at 2 s.d. on all graphs (±0.4‰).

All bone samples were measured in duplicate and mean values calculated.

Most of the dentine samples used to construct dietary profiles were analysed as single samples with selected increments measured in duplicate for quality control.

Bulk bone data was plotted on scatter charts, summary statistics calculated and non-parametric statistical tests carried out for comparative statistics using IBM SPSS 24.

Non-parametric tests were chosen due to the small and varying sample sizes of compared variables, and presence of outliers in the data.

PARAGRAPH

Some teeth were visibly worn through the occlusal enamel into the primary dentine.

In worn canines, the expected weaning signal was also missing from isotope profiles.

To combat offsets in age caused by this loss, the amount of dentine lost at the occlusal end of the sequence was estimated in millimetres (Table 1).

As each increment is 1 mm in width, this number of increments is equivalent to the number of estimated millimetres lost.

This number was then added to the total number of cut increments for each worn tooth in Eq. (2), to calculate a more accurate formation time per section.

The missing sections were also accounted for when assigning ages to each incremental section, with worn teeth starting at later ages than unworn teeth (see Supplementary information file).

Results and discussion

PARAGRAPH

With one exception from Cathedral Close (HFD-4241), all bone and dentine samples met the standards for collagen quality and yield.

C:N ratios were within the accepted range of 2.9–3.6 (DeNiro, 1985) and each sample had a collagen yield above 1% (van Klinken, 1999).

SECTION

Bone collagen and the burial populations

PARAGRAPH

Complete bone collagen results for the burial population at St. Guthlac's priory and Hereford Cathedral Close are presented in Table 2 and Fig. 2.

At St. Guthlac's Priory, δ13C values ranged from −20.4‰ to −18.1‰, with a mean value of −19.4 ± 0.5‰ at 1 s.d., and δ15N values from 8.3‰ to 13.3‰, with a mean value of 10.9 ± 1.2‰ at 1 s.d.

At the Cathedral Close, δ13C values are very similar, with a mean value of −19.6 ± 0.4‰ at 1 s.d. and ranging between −20.3‰ and −18.8‰.

Individuals from the Cathedral Close also have δ15N values that are very similar to those from St Guthlac's Priory, ranging from 8.5‰ to 12‰ with a mean of 10.4 ± 0.9‰ at 1 s.d.

PARAGRAPH

A Kruskal-Wallis H test indicates that the overall differences in the δ13C and δ15N values from the three different burial contexts are statistically insignificant (Table 3), indicating a demographic similarity between the two burial grounds and continuity in diet and health in Hereford throughout the Medieval Period.

Despite these similarities, the stable isotope data does portray variability between the individuals within each population.

While adults and males appear to have higher mean δ15N and δ13C values than females and children (Table 4), a Mann-Whitney test indicates differences between the two are statistically insignificant (Table 3).

Therefore, this variability does not appear to be heavily affected by biological sex or age.

Intra-population variability in burial populations at Medieval English sites in Yorkshire and Cheshire (Fig. 3) has been attributed to differences in social position.

For example, fish and meat was limited to the more affluent due to their higher price compared to that of grain and vegetables (Müldner and Richards, 2005, 2007a, 2007b; Richards et al., 2002; Woolgar et al., 2006, pp. 191–198).

At St. Guthlac's Priory, the three individuals with the highest δ15N values (HERF 9501, 9502, 9526) were buried in coffins, while the individuals with the lowest δ15N values (HERF 1801, 8114, 8501) were not.

As the presence of coffins has been associated with higher status, this indicates that, similarly to the Cheshire and Yorkshire populations, status influenced the intrapopulation variability at St. Guthlac's Priory.

PARAGRAPH

In the Yorkshire and Cheshire burial assemblages, variation in the δ13C and δ15N values between populations was largely attributed to differences between urban and rural environments, especially considering proximity to urban fishing rivers and trading centres (Müldner and Richards, 2005, 2007a, 2007b; Richards et al., 2002).

In agreement with this, the similarity between the two Hereford burial populations is not surprising, as both are associated with city parishes drawing from geographically similar populations.

Both Hereford sites are similar to the Yorkshire and Cheshire populations with regard to δ13C values, indicating a largely terrestrial diet.

In contrast, mean δ15N values in Hereford are considerably lower than those of the Yorkshire and Cheshire populations, with the exception of rural Wharram Percy, which had similarly low mean δ15N values (Fig. 3; Table 5).

This is somewhat surprising, as St. Guthlac's Priory and the Cathedral Close are both located within a trading centre (Hereford) and in proximity with the River Wye, which 18th century texts claim produced ‘extremely cheap’ fish, especially salmon, in Medieval times (Price, 1796, p. 66).

No δ13C and δ15N values are available for faunal bone or botanical remains in Herefordshire, so factors unique to the geographic area of Hereford cannot be accounted for.

For example, δ15N values for fish can vary considerably between different species and river systems (Dempson et al., 2009), and the effects of possible region-specific crop manuring practices that can affect the amount of nitrogen cycling in the food web cannot be taken into account (Bogaard et al., 2007).

Although the burial populations at St. Guthlac's Priory and the Cathedral Close may appear to have subsisted on a more plant-based diet than the comparative urban populations in Yorkshire and Cheshire, it is impossible to attempt such comparisons without geographic baseline data.

Intra-population variability may, however, be examined more closely by using incremental dentine analysis.

SECTION

Dentine collagen and the early life histories of five individuals at St. Guthlac's Priory

PARAGRAPH

The δ13C values of all individuals sampled for their incremental dentine ranged from −22.0‰ to −16.8‰ and δ15N values from 8.0‰ to 14.6‰, presenting greater variability in total than was found in the bone collagen (Figs. 4 and 5; Supplementary information file).

The individuals' combined dentine profiles have a mean range of 2.0‰ in δ13C values and 3.4‰ in δ15N, despite all five individuals having similar bone collagen isotope values.

Individuals without extensive occlusal tooth wear (5001, 9515 and 9543) have high δ15N values initially, which drop ~2‰ by two years of age, strongly indicative of weaning.

Similar patterns have been observed in populations ranging from the Medieval period to modern times, and are typically ascribed to weaning (Richards et al., 2002; Fuller et al., 2006; Burt, 2015; van der Sluis et al., 2015).

However, the δ13C profiles of the St. Guthlac's Priory individuals do not show the same expected drop with the lowered trophic level.

This may be caused by the averaging effects of dentine formation, as studies of modern infants indicate that the δ13C drop is more rapid than that of δ15N (Fuller et al., 2006).

It may also be related to other less-known physiological factors or the mother's diet and health (Beaumont et al., 2015).

Alternatively, the expected carbon shift to lower values could be compensated for by a change to a diet with a lower lipid content and hence higher δ13C, although to date this has mainly been observed in modern biological studies (McCutchan et al., 2003; Stott et al., 1999).

PARAGRAPH

Unique differences between the individuals analysed also highlight the way each person's individuality and different life experiences need to be considered when attempting to identify cultural trends in bone data.

For example, individual 9543, who was buried in a coffin, appears to have had higher δ15N values than the others until her early 20s.

Her terrestrial δ13C values during this period of elevated δ15N suggest freshwater fish or terrestrial meat consumption rather than significant marine protein consumption.

She was the only female included in the incremental analysis, and females have been reported to exhibit higher δ15N values during childhood than males due to unknown cultural or physiological factors (Henderson et al., 2014).

While she is the only female included in this analysis, making it difficult to say whether this is a factor in her case, coffins were mainly afforded to higher status individuals at St. Guthlac's, which suggests socioeconomic status may be the explanation for the high δ15N values observed in her case.

Another individual, 9526, has the largest range of δ15N values (10.4–14.0‰) among the group, manifesting a similar pattern during childhood as individual 9543.

This individual also had the highest δ13C and δ15N bone values of all analysed Hereford individuals and evidence of a large burial coffin suggests the individual may have been obese (Crooks, 2005).

Excluding adolescence, this individual appears to have maintained these high δ15N values from his early twenties, with δ13C values rising steadily throughout his earlier life, which may indicate increasing access to marine foods.

In conjunction with his possible obesity, this could indicate that this was an individual of relatively high socio-economic status due to increased access to food resources compared to the rest of the population.

PARAGRAPH

The remaining individuals (4001, 5001, 9515) are similar to each other, exhibiting relatively low δ13C and δ15N dentine values between the ages of 8 and 17 compared to the population's mean adult bone collagen values, and δ15N values that rise slightly above the population mean after age 18.

Interestingly, 5001 and 4001 were excavated from the southern part of the burial ground and exhibited various pathologies, such as cribra orbitalia (Roberts, 2005).

Although individual 9515 did have relatively high δ15N values around age 6 to 8, prior to this his profile fluctuates below the population mean.

Due to the presence of a mortuary chalice in his grave, it has been suggested that he may have been a priest, or at least associated with the clergy (Crooks, 2005).

However, his relatively low values contrast with several other ‘priest’ burials from other contemporary populations, where both δ13C and δ15N values were higher than those of the general population (Müldner and Richards, 2005, 2007b; Patrick, 2014).

Conversely, another possible priest from St. Giles, Yorkshire, expressed isotopic ratios similar to his population's mean (Müldner and Richards, 2005), implying that the possible priests at St. Guthlac's and St. Giles may have had diets comparable to those of the lay population.

PARAGRAPH

It is notable that the lowest δ15N values are generally present between the ages of 8 and 16 (Figs. 4, 5A–B).

This may be caused by one of two things: a specific adolescent diet prior to transitioning to an adult diet with higher levels of animal protein, as suggested at Wharram Percy (Richards et al., 2002) and Çatalhöyük, Turkey (Pearson et al., 2015), or changes in nitrogen fractionation associated with growth and development (Henderson et al., 2014; Waters-Rist and Katzenberg, 2010).

Similar patterns have been observed in several other burial populations, with connections being drawn between the main growth period of humans and reduced δ15N values between the ages of 10 and 18 (cf. Eerkens et al., 2016; Reitsema, 2013; van der Sluis et al., 2015; Waters-Rist and Katzenberg, 2010).

Fuller et al. (2004) have also observed lower δ15N values associated with increased BMI during pregnancy using hair, and a similar growth-related relationship has been reported in various animal species soft tissue, such as fish, birds and foxes (Minagawa and Wada, 1984; Roth and Hobson, 2000; Trueman et al., 2005).

Further, the dentine profile of a Neolithic individual from Sumburgh in Shetland (Montgomery et al., 2013) and an alternate primate species, the Rhesus monkey (Reitsema and Muir, 2015) bore lower δ15N values during adolescence than adulthood.

Although distinct species at different periods of time may undergo different fractionation processes, the pan-occurrence of this phenomenon within several species, as well as Neolithic, Medieval, and modern humans, would suggest a physiological effect rather than the widespread use of similar age-specific culturally influenced diets.

Nevertheless, isotopic changes during periods of growth have not been observed in some studies investigating this effect in bone, such as that of Waters-Rist and Katzenberg (2010), but they suggest this may be influenced by the slow rate of growth in long bones, which could mask any temporary dips in δ15N values.

The higher temporal resolution expressed by soft tissue and hair analysis is more equipped to show this feature, and it appears to be captured by the incremental data presented in this paper.

Supporting this, an incremental dentine study by Henderson et al. (2014) covering ages 0 to 8 also indicated lower δ15N values during childhood, which they relate to growth effects.

PARAGRAPH

As all the individuals analysed for their incremental dentine in this study survived into adulthood and had relatively high δ15N bone values, indicative of higher socioeconomic status, it could be concluded that they had comparatively healthy childhoods and experienced little physiological stress.

Therefore, these ~23-year dietary profiles may provide valuable insight into the early lives of typically unstressed individuals in Medieval Hereford.

In this context, the fact that the incremental δ15N and δ13C values of all five individuals fluctuate considerably until around age 18 to 20 (Figs. 4 and 5A–B), when they approach their bone value, is especially notable.

This underlines the need to consider and investigate more closely the possible effects of physiological processes related to growth, especially when comparing differences in bone collagen isotope data between (weaned) children/sub-adults and adult individuals.

These effects could have important interpretational consequences for bulk bone analyses.

For instance, individuals who did not reach adulthood may be more appropriately compared with their age group peers than adult individuals and the relatively high age resolution in childhood bulk bone data may offer a different kind of opportunity for intra population analyses.

Perhaps, dental seriation of presumably healthy individuals, such as the ones analysed in this paper, may be utilised as comparative data to assess whether deceased children within a burial population may have died from acute (e.g. an accident or acute infection) or chronic causes (e.g. long-term illness or prolonged malnutrition).

As incremental data from the young lives of long lived, presumably healthy individuals from the burial population could be understood to present a baseline for a relatively unstressed childhood, using them for comparison to childhood bulk bone data may be preferred to comparison with other bulk bone data.

Not only to individuals of another age group, because of the growth effect discussed above, but also to those who died during childhood, due to the high possibility of stress or malnutrition affecting the age group mean or median stable isotope value in bone collagen.

PARAGRAPH

For example, almost all analysed individuals at St. Guthlac's Priory who died during childhood have bone collagen values that fall within the upper and lower quartile ranges expressed by the corresponding age within the incremental dentine samples, for both δ15N and δ13C (Fig. 5A–B).

This suggests that their bone values represent normal, underlying physiological processes rather than poor long-term health or unusual diet, leading to the hypothesis that their death was sudden and not caused by a chronic condition.

Conversely, individual 1801 has a δ15N value that lies below the range of the values for the corresponding incremental dentine age, suggesting less access to animal protein throughout their young life compared to their similarly aged peers.

In fact, 1801's skeleton was noted as being askew in the grave, implying a hurried burial in the southern part of the burial ground and indicative of a lower socioeconomic status (Crooks, 2005).

SECTION

Conclusions

PARAGRAPH

The bone δ13C values presented in this paper show that there is little variation in the overall bulk bone values between different burial populations in Hereford, portraying high levels of continuity between Early and Late Medieval populations.

Furthermore, there is no statistically significant difference between individuals of varying age or sex.

The δ13C values are similar to those of other Medieval English populations, suggesting a largely terrestrial diet.

In contrast, the Hereford populations carry relatively low δ15N values compared to their Late Medieval counterparts, possibly caused by less access to 15N enriched protein, but lack of geographic and faunal data in proximity to Hereford means they cannot be accurately compared.

The incremental profiles present several similar characteristics, such as lower values during childhood, possibly caused by physiological processes related to growth and development, rather than a specific childhood diet or illness.

We suggest that the bone collagen δ13C and δ15N values of children and young adults should be considered separately from those of fully developed adults.

Furthermore, that the incremental dentine profiles of presumably healthy older adults may be used as intra-population standards with which to compare the bone collagen values of those who died during childhood in order to better identify outliers within that population.
