TITLE

Continuity and individuality in Medieval Hereford, England: A stable isotope approach to bulk bone and incremental dentine

PARAGRAPH

Analysis of stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes is regularly used to reconstruct diet in the past. 

While bone samples provide averaged results from the last several years of an individualâ€™s life, incremental dentine provides higher resolution of an earlier age. 

We found bone profiles between two demographically and temporally different burial populations from Medieval Hereford were statistically similar. 

By comparing them with canine and third molar dentine profiles of five individuals from one of the two sites, we found considerable variability and evidence to suggest that physiological processes during growth and development may influence the isotopic results.
