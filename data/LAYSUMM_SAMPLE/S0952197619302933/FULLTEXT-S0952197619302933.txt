TITLE

Optimal capacity allocation under random passenger demands in the high-speed rail network

SECTION

Introduction

PARAGRAPH

With the rapidly increasing requirement for “high-speed and high-density” railway transportation, the railway industry has to pursue the intelligence of railway transportation system.

Railway intelligent transportation system is a new generation system that is integrated by advanced intelligent technology, communication technology and information processing technology to fulfill the aims of guaranteeing safety, improving transportation efficiency, enhancing management and high service quality at lower cost (Li et al., 2003; Ning et al., 2006).

High-speed railway is a mode of transport with large capacity and high safety, which is mainly used as inter-city routes with heavy passenger transport (Wong et al., 2002).

Thus, effectively managing and operating the high-speed railways then becomes an important issue for the railway operators.

PARAGRAPH

In the daily railway operations, train timetables and capacity allocation are essential to the enhancement of profitability, level of service and competitiveness in the market for the high-speed rail network operators.

In practice, as a sub-problem of the train operating managements, train timetabling problem determines trains’ arrival and departure time at stations and yards, such that conflicts among trains will not occur and the transportation efficiency is improved.

And capacity allocation problem aims to find an optimal passenger allocation of capacity subject to constraints like maximum capacity, flow balance and so on to meet each demand.

As tactical plans of complex rail operations, trains timetables are programmed and updated every year or every season because of remarkable variation of passenger demands.

In reality, if consider the deterministic passenger demands, it would tend to use resources too tightly and may produce big variations in performance when applied in real-world operations.

In the worst situation, where demand fluctuates wildly during daily operations, the pre-specified timetable could be disturbed enough to lose its optimality.

It is obviously that if trains do not run under full load, it may cause unnecessary waste of resources.

So it is worth studying the capacity supply optimization problem under stochastic passenger fluctuation in operations.

In other words, to provide flexible train timetables based on the optimal capacity allocation to meet the fluctuation of daily passenger demands is necessary for the high-speed rail network operators.

Flexible train timetables can be implemented by autonomous decentralized train scheduling system in the integrated railway intelligent transportation system.

Details for concept of autonomous decentralized system have been described previously (Miyamoto et al., 1984; Mori et al., 1986; Ihara and Mori, 1984).

PARAGRAPH

In the real-world train timetabling problem, many factors have been considered including passenger demands, ticket prices, track capacity constraints, train capacity constraints, energy consumption, as well as maintenance and operating costs, which typically aims to construct a timetable that specifies a physical network route and detailed arrival and departure time for each train at passing stations.

In addition, passenger demands vary randomly in actual train timetabling problem.

Although determined train timetable under published timetable is easily implemented, but it may produce lower performance.

Therefore, to get a robust train timetable, not only trains and related capacity supplies have to be considered, but also stochastic fluctuations of passenger demands in daily operations should be considered.

It is of significance in practice, and has attracted tremendous attention from a variety of researchers over the past decades.

Many studies have adopted different effective methods to analysis the uncertainty of passenger demands in optimizing train timetable problem.

Under the fuzzy environment, the number of passengers getting on/off the train at each station was firstly treated as a fuzzy variable other than a crisp quantity (Yang et al., 2009).

It is a common way to treat scare data as a fuzzy variable according to the experience or expert’s evaluation.

However, compared with fuzzy variables, the method of stochastic programming is easier to deal with the influence of random parameters.

Then based on a stochastic programming with recourse framework, the robust single-track train dispatching problem under stochastic segment running times and capacity loss duration (Meng and Zhou, 2011) were studied, which incorporated different probabilistic scenarios.

They presented an example of adapting and extending known stochastic optimization frame work to meet the challenges of building realistic disruption handing tools under dynamic and uncertain data inputs.

Both of the above studies focused on the single-line railway, rather than rail network.

The research on the rail network is more necessary to accommodate the development of the modern railway.

Using the same method, a major Taiwan inter-city bus routing and timetable setting problem were studied with the stochastic variations of daily passenger demands and established a stochastic-demand timetabling model (Yan et al., 2006).

In order to improve the service quality and robustness against uncertain through minimizing the total waiting time of passengers, the robust multi-objective stochastic programming models (Hassannayebi et al., 2017) and a two-stage stochastic programming model (Shakibayifar et al., 2017) for train timetabling problem in the rail network were studied.

Besides, control strategy with simulation-based method is also used to deal with dynamic uncertain passenger demands in optimizing the train timetabling problem (Feng et al., 2017).

But too many assumptions should be considered and loses universality.

Further, the passenger arrival flow was assumed to be dependent on a discrete Markovian process to investigate robust train regulation problem (Li et al., 2016) and presented the stochastic stability condition for the train traffic subject to control constraints.

The Markovian processes are good models for many stochastic systems, including certain queuing systems, inventory systems and reliable systems.

But it is not suitable for systematic medium- and long-term forecasting.

In this paper, we not only propose a stochastic programming model to adapt the impact of random passenger demands, but also propose a strategy of optimizing timetable and train formation adjustment, which allows for quick optimization results.

PARAGRAPH

Given the inherent complexity for solving this problem, many algorithms were presented to deal with the uncertain passenger demands and realize real-time train operations.

The train routing and timetabling problem was formulated as a mixed integer programming model, and was solved using a fast heuristic algorithm based on the tabu search (Feng et al., 2018).

To solve a mixed-integer linear programming model of network design problem, a memetic algorithm (Wang et al., 2018) was developed to obtain high quality solutions.

Besides that, many meta-heuristics techniques were presented to provide useful ways of determining the initial solution, move rules, etc. (De et al., 2017a, b).

They proposed a hybrid particle swarm optimization with a basic variable neighborhood search algorithm, which has been proved to be successful is solving a variety of combinatorial problems and dealing with large size problems.

Besides that, many other superior meta-heuristics (particle optimization algorithm, genetic algorithm, etc.) are proposed to solve the problem in a large-scale realistic environment (De et al., 2019; Maiyar and Thakkar, 2018).

A particle swarm optimization-composite particle was employed to calculate ship routing and scheduling problem (De et al., 2016).

Further, a chemical reaction optimization algorithm was compared with the results with block-based genetic algorithm, genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization and performed better than others (De et al., 2018).

PARAGRAPH

To formulate a rail network capacity allocation scheme reasonably, the utilization rate of transport equipment capacity, the robustness and the efficiency of the capacity allocation process should be improved constantly on the basis of investigating the random variation of passenger flow of all lines in the rail network.

When establishing the draft timetable, operators formulate the train stop plan and determine the type and number of trains according to the passenger demands, the transportation equipment configuration conditions, physical properties (e.g., track curvature and gradient, maximum allowed speed and so on) and interaction among trains.

The draft timetable may be adjusted based on the actual operational situations.

In the past decades, there have been few studies on the capacity allocation problem based on the fluctuating passenger demands.

In order to deal a capacity allocation problem for the central headquarters that determines the capacity limits, the agent behavior and network flow models were incorporated (Demirag and Swann, 2007).

Then developed a mixed integer program and some simple heuristic algorithm to solve the problem.

By considering the formulation which maximizes the expected total profit over the possible decision under the uncertainty of demands, a heuristic algorithm for the capacity allocation problem with random demands in the rail container transportation was proposed (Cao et al., 2012).

PARAGRAPH

Despite the breakthroughs of the above studies, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, there has been few research on high-speed passenger capacity allocation problem and train timetabling problem under stochastic demands.

Specifically, this study intends to provide the following contributions to the frameworks of the capacity allocation problem based on the optimization methods:

PARAGRAPH

(1) Using the theory of rail network and the train and passenger flow space–time network representation respectively, a detailed description for the structure and characteristics of train capacity allocation problem under stochastic demands in the high-speed rail network is presented.

PARAGRAPH

(2) A two-stage stochastic integer programming model is provided to meet stochastic fluctuations of passenger demands in daily operations.

The model incorporates demand uncertainty and makes no assumptions for the rail network structure and distribution of passenger demands.

Then the model is rewritten as an integer programming model when assumes that there are finite number scenarios.

PARAGRAPH

(3) Since the complexity of large-scale models make it difficult to use the integer programming solvers to search for the optimal capacity allocations within an acceptable computational time, this research especially designs an efficient heuristic algorithm based on tabu search to obtain approximate optimal solutions in a short time.

Besides, some strategies are proposed to obtain an efficient timetable and train formation adjustment based on the near-optimal capacity allocations, whose objectives are uniform departure time of trains and minimizing the total travel time of all the involved trains.

PARAGRAPH

(4) Two sets of numerical experiments, in which a five-station rail network and the Beijing-Shanghai high-speed railway in China are performed to illustrate the applications and to evaluate the performance of the proposed model and solution algorithm.

The results demonstrate the correctness of the proposed models.

Further, sensitivity analyses are implied to verify the practicality of the proposed methods.

PARAGRAPH

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.

Section 2 gives the detailed problem statements.

The train capacity allocation problem under stochastic demands in the high-speed rail network is formulated as a two-stage stochastic integer programming model in Section 3.

Then we provide a heuristic algorithm based on tabu search and strategy to obtain an efficient timetable and train formation adjustment in Section 4, followed in Section 5 by numerical experiments to evaluate the performance of the proposed model and the solution method.

Section 6 draws some conclusions and outline directions for further research.

SECTION

Problem descriptions

PARAGRAPH

Capacity allocation is one of crucial factors to indicate the efficiency of a busy railway operations.

Practically, a variety of capacity allocation based on the daily volatile passenger demands can influence train formation plan.

From the viewpoint of the railway operators, the timetables development that meet randomly variable passenger demands can be regarded as one of key factors to affect the performance of the entire transportation systems.

Thus identifying the optimal capacity allocation and driving a more reasonable timetables become significant issues faced with the railway operation managers in the practical operations.

The scope of this study is optimizing the train timetabling operations for the given passenger demands based on a pre-given timetable which can provide the trains’ maximum capacity.

So for the purpose of detailed describing the problem, we focus on the following aspects.

SECTION

Rail network representation

PARAGRAPH

The two direction trains will not influence each other.

So in this paper we only consider the outbound trains in train timetabling problem in the double-track high-speed rail network as shown in Fig. 2.

There are 5 station represent by rectangles, and the track segments connecting stations represent by straight line with arrow.

In order to demonstrate the flow-balance behavior of trains clearly, the dummy nodes are introduced as shown in Fig. 3.

PARAGRAPH

In Fig. 3, the dummy node 0 is represent by hollow rectangle which means the place outside of the rail network where trains enter and depart.

The long dotted curve separates dummy node 0 and actual station.

As for the passengers, each actual station would be connected to a dummy nodes since there are passengers getting on and off at each station.

We assume that there are following four train service lines in the network (they arrive the origin station from outside of the network and leave the network from the terminal station):

PARAGRAPH

PARAGRAPH

PARAGRAPH

There are 10 possible passenger OD pairs shown in Table 2 in the high-speed rail network with 5 stations as shown in Fig. 3.

In high-speed rail operations, trains will not stop at every station, and not all stations have large passenger demands.

In this paper, we ignore the OD pairs at those stations whose passenger demands are small.

SECTION

PARAGRAPH

The train-flow and passenger-flow space–time network

PARAGRAPH

Besides that, the right side of Fig. 4 illustrates trains stop plan corresponding to the space–time network: the red nodes represent origin and destination of trains in the network, the green nodes represent stations where trains pass and stop and the hollow nodes represent stations where the train passes without stopping.

The arc that trains passing can be seen clearly in the Fig. of trains stop plan, which provides basis for maximum capacity calculating.

PARAGRAPH

The space–time network is also applied to mobility of passengers corresponding to certain times and stations.

As shown in Fig. 5, a passenger flow space–time network represents a specific OD pair.

Such networks are designed to be symmetrical to the train flow time–space networks.

The horizontal and vertical axes are defined as the same as those in the train flow space–time network.

An arc designates an activity that shows passenger movement.

Altogether, there are three types of arcs defined: delivery arc, holding arc and demand arc.

A delivery arc represents passengers being transported from one station to another on the corresponding train.

A holding arc indicates that the passengers stay at a station to transfer.

And a demand arc connects the origin station and the terminal station of the network’s corresponding OD pair, which denotes the service demands for the OD pair that would actually be served in the network.

Mathematical formulations

PARAGRAPH

In this section we formally propose a two-stage stochastic integer programming model for capacity allocation problem under stochastic demands in the high-speed rail network by using network optimization techniques.

Before introducing the model, to facilitate problem solving, we make the following assumptions:

PARAGRAPH

PARAGRAPH

For stations which involve many service lines, passengers may held for a period to transfer from one train to another.

In this paper we assume the cost of transferring is a constant.

PARAGRAPH

PARAGRAPH

Due to the fluctuation of passenger demands in high-speed train operations, in the solution process, we consider the estimated number of passenger demands at each arc randomly based on the actual situation, instead of considering the detailed number of passengers getting on/off each train at each station.

Besides that, as stated in Section 2.1, the OD passenger demands are not existing among all nodes in the network, thus we ignore the OD pairs at those stations whose passenger demands are very small.

PARAGRAPH

PARAGRAPH

All trains in the carrier’s operation are assumed as the same size in this paper.

And only one class of ticket price is taken into account.

SECTION

The stochastic programming theory and notations introduction

PARAGRAPH

Stochastic program aims at modeling optimization problems that involve uncertainty in the parameters.

Stochastic integer programs (Birge and Louveaux, 1997) are those for which some decision variables are required to be integer or binary.

Although some exact and approximate methods have been proposed to solve specific problems, there are no general efficient methods for solving general stochastic integer programs.

Model formulation for capacity allocation problem under random passenger demands

PARAGRAPH

PARAGRAPH

The train capacity allocation problem in non-double track rail network is different from the problem considered in this paper.

For example, meet and pass constraints should be considered in the single track rail network due to the fact that trains can meet and pass only at stations and sidings.

PARAGRAPH

PARAGRAPH

There exists a feasible solution for the stochastic integer programming model (M1).

PARAGRAPH

In fact, all decision variables may be taken zero to get a trivial feasible solution for the stochastic integer programming model (M1).

PARAGRAPH

PARAGRAPH

All feasible solutions have bounds for the stochastic integer programming model (M1).

PARAGRAPH

Because all decision variables have bounds in the stochastic integer programming model (M1), all feasible solutions of the stochastic integer programming model (M1) also have bounds.

In summary, we can infer that there must be an optimal solution of M1.

SECTION

Solution methodology

SECTION

Tabu search heuristic algorithm

PARAGRAPH

As introduced above, we have to optimize capacity allocation that could best absorb stochastic demand disturbances.

For a large-scale problem, it would cost a significant amount of time to solve and may not even get the optimal solution in a reasonable computation time.

Actually, there are tens of thousands of integer decision variables in the real-world capacity allocation problem with random demands.

In order to obtain a better feasible solution than the previous one at each step, and obtain a high quality feasible solution in a reasonable calculation time, we attempt to design a meta-heuristic algorithm: tabu search heuristic algorithm (TSHA) to obtain a near-optimal solution of the mathematical model (M2).

PARAGRAPH

The tabu search algorithm was first introduced by Glover (1986).

It is a deterministic meta-heuristic on account of local search, which makes extensive use of memory for guiding the search (Corman et al., 2010).

And it can well avoid being trapped in local optimal and re-visiting the same solution.

Therefore, a heuristic algorithm based on tabu search is designed according to the characteristic of the proposed model in this paper.

To illustrate the solution process clearly, the detailed procedure of TSHA is first given in Table 5.

PARAGRAPH

The TSHA is realized by repeating search process from a feasible solution to another better one as illustrated in Fig. 6.

There are three important aspects in the process.

One is that we need determine a good quality initial feasible solution which can greatly improve the efficiency of searching.

The other is the establishment of incumbent solution neighborhood which should be done if it fails to meet iterative termination conditions.

It is crucial for a better direction of the search, which affects the quality of solution at each step.

In addition to this, the aspiration criterion is set to reinforce the local search to avoid losing an admirable state.

That is, if a solution in the tabu list is largely superior to others, then reconsider and search it as a new incumbent solution.

The other solutions are forbidden in the tabu list to avoid being trapped in local optimal or infinite loops.

To deal with the problems mentioned above in the model presented in this paper, we discuss the selection of initial solution, the setting of the neighborhood of incumbent solution and the aspiration criterion of algorithm in detail below.

PARAGRAPH

Determined of initial solution: Since most real-world optimization problems involve multiple constrains, which are not easy to find feasible solutions.

It has been proven that all decision variables may be taken zero to get a trivial feasible solution for the stochastic integer programming model M1.

So in this paper, we start from it to obtain a good quality feasible solution to be the initial solution of TSHA.

In the process of seeking the optimal capacity allocation, we use the objective function of the model M2 to measure the priority of each feasible solution.

The procedure is summarized in Table 6.

Strategy of optimizing timetable and train formation adjustment

PARAGRAPH

Numerical experiments

PARAGRAPH

In this section, two experiments are implemented to show the performance of the proposed model and algorithms.

Specifically, the small case is implemented to demonstrate their applications and performances.

While the Beijing-Shanghai high-speed railway is applied to illustrate the performance of proposed model and the algorithm when applies to a real-world train timetabling problem under stochastic demands.

To understand the influence of the stochastic demand disturbances on the solution, we also performed sensitivity analyses on the mean of the passenger demands.

The algorithm has been coded in PYTHON 2.7.14 and run under Microsoft Windows 10 platform with Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-8550U CPU and 8G RAM.

SECTION

A small-scale case study

PARAGRAPH

The number of retained trains are calculated by the capacity allocation on each arc between two stations.

After being calculated by SOTTFA, a near optimal timetable for the problem is given as shown in Table 12 based on the approximate optimal link capacity allocations obtained by solving model (M2) and the strategy proposed in Chapter 3.

It is worth mentioning that the exact solution is calculated by commercial software Cplex and is compared to the results solved by the proposed algorithm.

The capacity allocation results and the optimized timetable of them are the same under the determined passenger demands.

SECTION

Large-scale case experiment

PARAGRAPH

The Beijing-Shanghai high-speed railway, connecting two major cities, Beijing and Shanghai, with length of 1318 km and 23 intermediate stations (see Fig. 8), which was opened on June 30, 2011.

The railway operates with high speed trains which have the top speed of 350 km per hour in commercial service.

And in this paper, according to the high-speed railway ticket fare setting in China, we consider the fare is CN¥0.46 per km without considering the fares of different seats.

PARAGRAPH

Fig. 11 shows the comparison of passenger allocation and maximum capacity of trains.

Since the timetable as shown in Appendix is set to provide the maximum capacity, it is adjustable slightly and the train formation also can be adjusted.

The passenger allocations from Jinan West to Xuzhou East are almost equal to trains’ capacity, so the corresponding trains need not be adjusted as shown in Fig. 11.

Besides that, the timetable and train formation who travel from Beijing South to Jinan West and from Wuxi East to Shanghai Hongqiao should be adjust.

Due to the situation that there are unknown passenger demands outside of the Beijing-Shanghai high-speed railway, we adjust the train formation instead of reducing the redundant trains.

So from the stop plan, the capacity of trains and the near optimal passenger allocation, we adopt SOTTFA to calculate.

Then the result is that the coupled 16-car trains which involve Line G175, Line G471, Line G177, Line G179, Line G27, Line G181, Line G473 and Line G183, whose origin and destination station are Beijing South and Jinan West respective, and Line G7597, Line G1735, Line G7575, Line G7131, Line G7127, Line G7571, Line G7135, Line G7563, Line G7195 and Line G7139, who travel from Nanjing South to Shanghai Hongqiao on the Beijing-Shanghai high-speed railway that can be adjusted and those trains are marked in the timetable of Appendix.

In fact, there are many trains passing from Beijing to Jinan and from Nanjing to Shanghai due to the relatively large passenger demands, but not all trains passing through the Beijing-Shanghai high-speed railway.

At the same time, the passenger demands considered in this paper are those on the Beijing-Shanghai high-speed railway.

Thus extra capacity can provide for the arc from Beijing to Jinan and from Nanjing to Shanghai whose passenger demands are large.

SECTION

Mean passenger demand sensitivity analyses

PARAGRAPH

The sensitivity analyses are performed on the mean of the passenger demand, which is analyzed to test the influence for the timetable adjustment if the passenger demand increases or decreases.

The passenger demand should not change too much for suit the real-world situation.

Thus in this paper, we tested two more situations, 80% and 120% of the original mean based on the small-scale case as stated in Section 5.1.

PARAGRAPH

After being calculated by SOTTFA, we get the near optimaltimetable respectively.

The timetable comparison of the three situations is presented in Table 18.

Comparing to the optimized timetable Table 12 under the original mean, the situation that 80% of the original mean can reduce a train on Line 1 whose departure time is 7:50.

In addition to this, the number and departure time of the other trains in Table 12 are not change.

For the other situation that 120% of the original mean of passenger demand, a train on Line 2 whose departure time is 8:05 should be adding.

Besides that, the passenger allocations on Line 1 and Line 4 are saturated, which can be studied to add additional trains that not limited by the pre-given plan timetable.

PARAGRAPH

From the above analysis, we can know that for the low passenger demand, we can obtain low passenger allocations relatively and reasonable timetable after reducing redundant trains, at the same time adjusting the train formation from coupled 16-car to 8-car trains.

For the high passenger demand, a higher passenger allocations are obtained to optimize timetable.

And many trains can run under fully loaded.

The result shows that the proposed model and the solution algorithm can optimize the train timetabling operations based on a given passenger demand and it is consistent with the real-world situation.

SECTION

Conclusions

PARAGRAPH

In this paper, we propose a stochastic integer programming model for passenger capacity problem under random passenger demands and some strategies for optimizing train timetabling problem in the high-speed rail network by using network optimization techniques.

Then rewrite it as an integer programming model when assumes that there are finite number scenarios.

The model incorporates demand uncertainty and makes no assumptions for the rail network structure and distribution of passenger demands.

And it needs data from train service planning and online scheduling system to provide available transport capacities as well as all associated prices and costs.

Historical data is gathered and maintained over time to permit forecasting the variation of passenger demands.

In addition, we provide a tabu-based algorithm and strategies in order to obtain approximate optimal solutions and near-optimal timetable for the problem in a short time.

PARAGRAPH

There are two possibilities for future research.

One can consider the high speed train timetabling problem under stochastic demands and several different classes of ticket prices.

In this research, we assume that only one class of ticket price in the problem, but it is not reasonable.

Another future research topic is the more detailed timetable optimization problem, which needs to optimize train stop plan, dwelling time at station etc. to obtain more optimal timetables, rather than by reducing or increasing the number of trains.
