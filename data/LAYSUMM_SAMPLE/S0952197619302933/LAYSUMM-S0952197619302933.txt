TITLE

Optimal capacity allocation under random passenger demands in the high-speed rail network

PARAGRAPH

As tactical plans of complex rail operations, train timetables are programmed and updated every year or every season because of remarkable variation of passenger demands. 

From the optimization perspective, this paper aims to investigate a detailed description and optimal methods (a two-stage stochastic integer programming model and corresponding heuristic algorithm) to efficiently obtain a near-optimal timetable and passenger allocation of trainsâ€™ capacity under the fluctuation of daily passenger demands. 

Through implementing on the Beijing-Shanghai high-speed rail network in China, we verify the performance and effectiveness of the proposed methods.
